Sure, here are the formulas for the calculations you mentioned:

1. Calculate Electricity Bill: 
   Electricity Bill = (Wattage x Hours used) / 1000 x Cost per unit

2. Calculate Average Of N Numbers:
   Average = (Sum of all numbers) / (Total number of numbers)

3. Calculate Discount Of Product:
   Discount = Marked Price - Selling Price

4. Calculate Distance Between Two Points:
   Distance = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)

5. Calculate Commission Percentage:
   Commission Percentage = (Commission / Sale Amount) x 100

6. Calculate Depreciation of Value:
   Depreciation = (Initial Value - Final Value) / Useful Life

7. Calculate Batting Average:
   Batting Average = Total Runs Scored / Number of times Out

8. Calculate CGPA:
   CGPA = (Sum of (Grade Point x Credit)) / Total Credits

9. Compound Interest:
   Compound Interest = P*(1+r/n)^(n*t) - P
   where P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year, and t is the time period in years.

10. Calculate Average Marks:
    Average Marks = (Sum of all marks obtained) / (Total number of subjects)

11. Find Ncr & Npr:
    Ncr = n! / r! * (n-r)!
    Npr = n! / (n-r)!
    where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items taken at a time.

12. Future Investment Value:
    Future Value = Present Value * (1 + (Interest Rate/100))^n
    where Present Value is the amount invested, Interest Rate is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years.
