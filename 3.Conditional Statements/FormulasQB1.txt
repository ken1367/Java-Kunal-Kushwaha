Sure, here are the formulas you requested:

Area Of Circle = π × radius²
Area Of Triangle = (1/2) × base × height
Area Of Rectangle Program = length × breadth
Area Of Isosceles Triangle = (1/2) × base × height
Area Of Parallelogram = base × height
Area Of Rhombus = (diagonal₁ × diagonal₂) / 2
Area Of Equilateral Triangle = (sqrt(3)/4) × side²
Perimeter Of Circle = 2 × π × radius
Perimeter Of Equilateral Triangle = 3 × side

Perimeter Of Parallelogram = 2 × (length + breadth)
Perimeter Of Rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth)
Perimeter Of Square = 4 × length
Perimeter Of Rhombus = 4 × length
Volume Of Cone = (1/3) × π × radius² × height
Volume Of Prism = base area × height
Volume Of Cylinder = π × radius² × height
Volume Of Sphere = (4/3) × π × radius³
Volume Of Pyramid = (1/3) × base area × height
Curved Surface Area Of Cylinder = 2 × π × radius × height
Total Surface Area Of Cube = 6 × side²


Note that in the formulas above, π represents the mathematical constant pi (approximately equal to 3.14159), radius refers to the distance from the center of a circle or sphere to its edge, and base and height refer to the dimensions of the relevant shapes.
